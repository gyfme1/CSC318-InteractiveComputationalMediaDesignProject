## Motivation

- UTM study spaces are often packed with students. It is hard to find a spot that fulfills with certain needs
- Students donâ€™t know which building has the most availability

---

## Target User

- Current UTM Students who often study on campus

---

## User Reserch


### Questionnaire 
- Two questionnaires were distributed
- Targeted users included UTM students
- Second questionnaire was a modified version of the first to eliminate bias 

#### Questionnaire #1 Results and analysis
- A higher demand for using school facilities from upper year students
- The quiet and silent zones are the most popular study spaces chosen
- Around 80% of participants used school facilities

#### Questionnaire #2 Results and analysis

- Students are not always using the library
- Besides the silent/quiet zones, different majors required students to seek specialized study spaces
- More 2nd Years and 1st Years responded this time
- Students often find their first desired study spot to be occupied

### Interview
- 11 questions
- interviews were made with consent
- All interviewees are UTM students from different programs

#### Analysis:
- Students in different programs usually go to different study space

## Product Prototype

### Usability Test Results & Problem of Lo-fi Prototype

- Presentation of availability bars is not clear
- Too complicated operating system
- Do not have any quick search functions
- User does not know whether the index page can scroll up/down
- Indication of needed facilities in the output page is not convenient. User needs to check through every floors to find needed facilities
